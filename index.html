# AWS VPC Web Server Project

This project shows how I created a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS with a public subnet, route table, internet gateway, security group, and an EC2 instance running a web server. It demonstrates my understanding of AWS networking and compute services.

## Architecture Overview

This project includes:
- Custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
- Public subnet
- Internet Gateway
- Route table with route to the IGW
- Security group allowing HTTP and SSH
- EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2023)
- NGINX web server
- SSH key pair for secure access

## Live Demo

My project website is hosted using GitHub Pages:

## What I Learned

- How to design a VPC
- How subnets, route tables, and IGW work
- How to configure security groups
- How to launch an EC2 instance
- How to connect using SSH
- How to install NGINX on EC2
- How to host a static site with GitHub Pages
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control

## Technologies Used
